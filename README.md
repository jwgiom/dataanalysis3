# dataanalysis3

This is a repo for the Data Analysis 3 class at the University of Exeter (SOC2094/3094 POL2094/3094).

Folders:
- slides: I'll put the slides here
- outline: The module outline is here (please read it!)
- data: Put the UndSoc data there (do not change anything, the next subfolder in data should be UKDA-6614-tab). Do not track this folder; it must be stored locally (this is why it doesn't show on Github)

As the course progresses I'll update this repo with new scripts
