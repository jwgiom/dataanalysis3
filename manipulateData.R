# W1 is a data frame from the Understanding Society wave 1 with only a few selected variables

library(tidyverse)

# 1. Read W1 into R (it's a csv file). Explore the contents of the data using the data dictionary.

# 2. What is a pipe operator (%) and how to use it

# 3. Selecting variables: select()
# Exercise: only select the variables for id and measures of weight and height and save the result
# as a new data frame.
# How can we do this in base R?

# 4. Selecting cases: filter()
# a) Select only women aged 18 to 25
# b) select only people born in Wales or Northern Ireland and aged over 40

# 5. Creating new variables: mutate()
# a) create a new dummy variable that takes a value 1 if a person was born in Scotland
# and 0 otherwise

# More complicated case: create two (cleaned) variables for people's height in cm
# and weight in kg. (You can use dplyr or base R).
? if_else
? ifelse

# Create a variable for body mass index.

# 6. Sorting cases: arrange()
# a) Arrange cases in the descending order by age

# 7. Summarising data: summarise()

# a) Use summarise to find mean and median BMI and the proportion of people
# with BMI > 30 in the sample of people aged 25 to 55.

# 8. Producing summary statistics by group:
# group_by() and summarise()

# Group the same by sex and age ("young": 18-35, "middle-aged": 36-55, "older": >55)
# and produce mean and median BMI and the proportion of people with BMI over 30 in each group.

# *********************

# Iteration in R


# 1. For loops
for (i in 1:5) {
  print(i)
}

# (i in 1:5): sequence
# {
#   print(i)
# }: body

# Calculating the number of characters in words
for (i in c("red", "blue", "yellow")) {
  print(nchar(i))
}

# R is a vectorised language and this is why we rarely use loops in R

nchar(c("red", "blue", "yellow"))

# 2. while loops

i = 1
# This is equivalent to i <- 1
while (i < 6) {
  print(i)
  i = i + 1
}

# (i < 6): condition
# {
#   print(i)
#   i = i + 1
# }: body
# i is a counter

# With while loops it is easy to write an infinite loop.
# Do not run:
# i = 1
# while (i < 6) {
#   print(i)
# }

# 3. repeat loops

i = 1
repeat {
  print(i)
  i = i + 1
  if (i > 5) break
}

# rarely used


# Exercises:

# 1. From here - http://www-math.bgsu.edu/~zirbel/programming/index.html
# Write some lines of code that will calculate the sum 1+2+3+...+300. 
# The idea is to create a variable that will store the current value of the sum.
# Set it to zero, then use a for loop that will run through the numbers 1, 2, 3, ... 
# and add each of these to the current sum.  After the for loop, output the value of the sum. 

# 2. Write some lines of code to calculate the sum 1路2+2路3+3路4+ ... + 249路250.

# 3. Write a program to calculate 10! ("10 factorial"), which is defined to be 10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1.

# 4. From here: http://maths-people.anu.edu.au/~johnm/courses/r/exercises/pdf/r-exercises.pdf
# (a) Create a for loop that, given a numeric vector, prints out one number per line,
# with its square and cube alongside.
# (b) Look up help(while). Show how to use a while loop to achieve the same result.
# (c) Show how to achieve the same result without the use of an explicit loop.
